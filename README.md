# DoNotCall Database Builder
 Builds a complete up to date database with the blocked caller list

# Process
 So the files are pretty big for prebuilt database. If you would like to build your own, by all means just delete all the files but py and run the files.
1. Create a file called DncApiKey.txt and put a apikey on a line. If you would like to do multiple just input following keys on following lines. This is so that we can bypass the limitation of amount able to grab.
2. Run main.py to be able to get options. It is suggested to run them in order and make sure everything completes fully before moving to another section
3. If you want to just search for a phone number run recallPhone.py
4. cleanComp.py is for cleaning up the database which should be ran after main.py
